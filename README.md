🚢 Titanic Survival Quest: Navigating the Abyss of Data
In this epic saga, we plunge into the Titanic dataset to decode the secrets of survival. With a captain’s resolve, we explore passenger records, cleanse turbulent data, and deploy a trio of machine learning titans—Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree—to forecast who might have survived the tragedy.

🎯 Objectives
Exploration:
Unveil patterns in survival rates across age, gender, class, and embarkation points through vibrant visualizations.

Data Cleaning: Tackle missing values and encode categorical variables for machine learning readiness.

Modeling: Train and compare three classifiers to predict survival with high accuracy.

Insights: Crown the best model and deliver predictions that illuminate historical truths.

🐧 Penguin Data Odyssey: Charting the Arctic Analytics
In this frosty expedition, we venture into the Palmer Penguins dataset, a treasure trove of biometric data. From species distributions to body mass trends, we craft mesmerizing visualizations and harness machine learning to predict penguin gender with surgical precision.

🎯 Objectives
Exploration: Map out species, island, and gender distributions with pie charts, bar plots, and more.

Visualization: Create histograms, box plots, 3D scatter plots, and correlation matrices to reveal biometric relationships.

Prediction: Train classifiers like Random Forest, SVM, and KNN to predict penguin gender, complete with confusion matrices and accuracy comparisons.

Insights: Test hypothetical penguin data to showcase real-world applicability.


🌟 Features

Titanic Survival Quest
Dynamic Visualizations: Count plots, distribution charts, and survival rate analyses bring passenger stories to life

Robust Preprocessing: Drops irrelevant columns (e.g., Name, Ticket) and encodes categorical variables (Sex, Embarked).

Model Armada: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree classifiers battle it out, evaluated via accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports.

Crowning Champion: Random Forest reigns supreme, predicting survival with flair on both training and test data.


Penguin Data Odyssey
Vivid Visualizations:
Pie charts for species and gender distributions.
Bar plots for island counts.
Histograms with box plots for biometric features (culmen length, flipper length, body mass).
3D scatter plots, violin plots, pair plots, and parallel coordinate plots for multidimensional insights.
Correlation Analysis: Heatmaps reveal relationships between numeric features.

Gender Prediction:
Five classifiers (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, KNN) predict penguin gender.
Confusion matrices and a bar plot compare model performance.
Sample Testing: Predicts gender for hypothetical penguin data, demonstrating practical use.
